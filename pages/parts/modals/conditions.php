Don't wanna hear it's over
What a rude awakening
Angel of death has come and ripped you from my life
I can't stand the devastation
Relentless agony
Hope that I get to see you on the other side
Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore
What faith I had is broken
And I question everything
And those shards of doubt begin to penetrate my heart
With every waking hour
Within everything I see
The shadows of your loss are tearing my apart
Blue sky has turned to blackest night
Now you're gone, it just isn't right
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore
My world is shattered and disarrayed
I'm beaten down, drained emotionally
They say in time the pain goes away
But in my soul it will forever stay
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter
Save our last goodbye
Embedded in my mind, your face will never leave me
Save our last goodbye
It's killing me that I won't get to hear your laughter anymore
